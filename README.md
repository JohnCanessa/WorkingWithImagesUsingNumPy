# WorkingWithImagesUsingNumPy
Working with images using NumPy from PluralSight course

This is a modified exercise from the PluralSight course

by Janani Ravi.

If interested in my comments I invite you to read the associated
pot in my blog:

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to read, 
experiment, and repeat.

Enjoy,

John
